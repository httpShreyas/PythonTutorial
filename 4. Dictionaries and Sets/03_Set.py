s = {1,5,32,2,3,3,3,3,1,32,} #is a set

Properties of sets

Sets are unordered  (Element's order doesnt matter)

Sets are unindexed  (Cannot access elements by index)

There is no way to change items in sets

You cannot have a list contained in a set

Sets cannot contain duplicate values
'''

#A set can contain number as a string as well as an integer
#Tip: in sets, 20.0 = 20 but its not equal to "20"
