This repo documents my learning progress right from a beginer.

It is a collection of the notes, example codes, error solutions, and projects that I have completed through the timeline.
With sources ranging from the python documentation, youtube videos, github repositories and college lectures.

The work is in progress, the quality of notes, codes, key points and projects will gradually improve with time.
